# Trader Specialist Rarity Tweak
Changes the weighting of each rarity for the four neutral traders (Diana/Valeria/Manx/Procurator) in Anno 117

Values are the same for each trader by default but different weightings are used if my Specialist Pools Rebalanced mod is installed.

# New Percentage Values for Each Rarity
| Rarity     | Base Game | This Mod |
| -------    | -------   | -------  |
| Common     | 58   | 20  |
| Rare       | 34   | 40  |
| Epic       | 7    | 30  |
| Legendary  | 1    | 10  |
